# Process and result

This was the first big project we received and we were tasked with building an entire website. Although we only used vanilla HTML and CSS. We did not use any javascript so there was no real functionality to the site.

The design process was fun and I wanted to create a site that had more cozy, "earthy" and intimate feel rather than a typical modern look.

The design is not perfect by any means, but based off of what I was aming for I think it turned out alright.

The HTML and (especially) the CSS code was quite messy and unorganized at this point. But I learned a few things in that regard that I used in future projects. Particularly in regard of use of classes.

# Assignment

Logo was given to us as part of the project. However the one I used on the finished site was slightly altered in photoshop.
